Description: Tiny scripting language with ECMA script syntax
 Ucode is a tiny script language featuring ECMA script syntax, builtin JSON
 support and templating using Jinja inspired markup. The ucode VM is provided
 as shared library with a C API allowing embedding into host applications and
 interchanging data between ucode and C programs. The ucode VM can also be
 used as stand-alone multi purpose scripting language through the provided
 ucode cli interpreter.
 .
 This package contains the ucode command line interpreter, which is required
 to develop, debug and precompile ucode scripts.
