Statement and expression blocks may contain C-style comments.
A C-style comment is started by a slash followed by an asterisk
and ended by an asterisk followed by a slash.

Such comments may appear everywhere within statement or expression
blocks, even in the middle of statements or expressions.

-- Expect stdout --
The result of 12 - 4 is 8.
Statement blocks may use C comments too: Test Another test. The final test.
-- End --

-- Testcase --
The result of 12 - 4 is {{ /* A comment before */ 12 - /* or even within */ 4 /* or after an expression */ }}.
Statement blocks may use C comments too: {%+
	print("Test"); /* A comment. */

	/* Another comment. */
	print(" Another test.");

	print(/* A comment within */ " The final test.");
%}

-- End --
