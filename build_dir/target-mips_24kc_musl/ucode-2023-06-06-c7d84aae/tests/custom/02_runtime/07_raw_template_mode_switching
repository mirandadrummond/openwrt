Testing that require(), render() and include() properly toggle between
raw- and template parse mode.


1. Testing recursive invocation.

-- Testcase --
require("files.requiretest");
print(render("files/render-test.uc"));
include("files/include-test.uc");
-- End --

-- Args --
-R
-- End --

-- File requiretest.uc --
print("This is a raw mode file loaded by require()\n");
print(render("require-render-test.uc"));
include("require-include-test.uc");
-- End --

-- File require-include-test.uc --
print("This is a raw mode file included by a required file\n");
-- End --

-- File require-render-test.uc --
This is a {{ "template mode" }} file rendered by a required file
-- End --

-- File render-test.uc --
This is a {{ "template mode" }} file loaded by render() from a raw mode file
-- End --

-- File include-test.uc --
print("This is a raw mode file loaded by include() from a raw mode file\n");
-- End --

-- Expect stdout --
This is a raw mode file loaded by require()
This is a template mode file rendered by a required file
This is a raw mode file included by a required file
This is a template mode file loaded by render() from a raw mode file
This is a raw mode file loaded by include() from a raw mode file
-- End --
