Testing closure scopes.


1. Ensure that the declaring scope is retained in functions.

-- Expect stdout --
Make function with x=1
Make function with x=2
Make function with x=3
x is 1
x is 2
x is 3
-- End --

-- Testcase --
{%
	let count=0;

	function a() {
		let x = ++count;
		print("Make function with x=", x, "\n");
		return function() {
			print("x is ", x, "\n");
		};
	}

	let fn1 = a();
	let fn2 = a();
	let fn3 = a();

	fn1();
	fn2();
	fn3();
%}
-- End --
