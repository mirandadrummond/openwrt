When compiling certain expressions as first statement of an ucode
program, e.g. a while loop in raw mode, a jump instruction to offset
zero is emitted which was incorrectly treated as placeholder by the
compiler.

-- Testcase --
while (i++ < 1)
	print("Test\n");
-- End --

-- Args --
-R
-- End --

-- Expect stdout --
Test
-- End --
